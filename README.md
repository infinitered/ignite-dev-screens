# Ignite Dev Screens

## Why is this archived?

We really appreciate all the community support in the years since we first released ignite-dev-screens. Our focus has shifted to the latest version of [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite), which does not have a plugin-based architecture ([read more here](https://shift.infinite.red/introducing-ignite-4-0-flame-1dfc891f9966)). Feel free to fork this library and continue on its legacy if you want. 

This npm packages contains the development screens for [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) generated projects.

## Usage

Generate an Ignite project and then add this plugin:

```shell
$ ignite add dev-screens
```

## What it does

When you add this plugin to your Ignite project, some files will be added to `ignite/DevScreens`. These contain some styled utility screens where you can view components, play with various Ignite features, and add your own components during development.

To remove Ignite DevScreens from your project, just delete `ignite/DevScreens`.
