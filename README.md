## Usage

Generate an Ignite project and then add this plugin:

```shell
$ ignite add dev-screens
```

## What it does

When you add this plugin to your Ignite project, some files will be added to `ignite/DevScreens`. These contain some styled utility screens where you can view components, play with various Ignite features, and add your own components during development.

To remove Ignite DevScreens from your project, just delete `ignite/DevScreens`.
